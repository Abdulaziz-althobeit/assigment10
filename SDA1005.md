# Week 10 Assignment – Deploying a MERN Blog Application on AWS

## Overview

This document details the deployment of a MERN Stack blog platform on AWS utilizing free-tier eligible services, emphasizing a scalable and cost-efficient infrastructure.

## Technology Stack Used

* MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based database hosting
* Express.js and Node.js for backend API services
* React.js (Vite) for the frontend interface
* Amazon EC2 to serve the backend application
* Amazon S3 for both frontend hosting and media storage
* IAM (Identity and Access Management) for permission control
* PM2 for managing Node.js processes
* pnpm for efficient frontend dependency installation

## Deployment Breakdown

### 1. Database – MongoDB Atlas

* Set up a free-tier cluster on MongoDB Atlas.
* Created a database user and whitelisted the EC2 instance’s IP address.
* Connection URI added to the backend’s `.env` configuration file.

### 2. Frontend Hosting via Amazon S3

* Bucket name: `sda1005-blogapp-frontend`
* Enabled static website hosting with `index.html` as the entry document.
* Configured a bucket policy to allow public access.
* Deployment steps:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    pnpm run build
    aws s3 sync dist/ s3://sda1006-blogapp-frontend/
    ```

### 3. Media File Storage – S3 Bucket

* Created another S3 bucket: `sda1006-blogapp-media`
* Configured CORS settings to support media uploads from the browser.
* Verified upload functionality through test operations.

### 4. IAM Configuration for S3 Access

* Created an IAM user named `blog-app-user`.
* Applied a custom permission policy for accessing the media bucket.
* Temporarily granted `AmazonS3FullAccess` during development.
* Used `aws configure` on the EC2 instance to securely store credentials.

### 5. Backend Setup on EC2

* Launched an Ubuntu 22.04 EC2 instance (`t3.micro`, region: `eu-north-1`).
* Security group allows inbound traffic on ports 22, 80, 443, and 5000.
* User Data script installs essential tools (git, Node.js, pm2, awscli, etc.).
* Cloned the backend repository and added `.env` with:

    ```ini
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB=<your-connection-string>
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
    S3_BUCKET=sda1005-blogapp-media
    MEDIA_BASE_URL=[https://sda1006-blogapp-media.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com](https://sda1006-blogapp-media.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com)
    ```

### 6. Process Management with PM2

* Installed PM2 globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g pm2
    ```
* Started the backend server:

    ```bash
    pm2 start index.js --name "blog-backend"
    ```
* Saved the PM2 process list to enable auto-restart after reboot:

    ```bash
    pm2 save
    ```

## Verification & Deliverables

* PM2 showing backend running persistently.
* Frontend accessible via public S3 URL.
* Media upload functionality verified.
* `curl -I` confirms frontend availability with HTTP 200 response.

## Security & Best Practices

* IAM credentials are excluded from version control.
* `.env` files are kept private; sample configuration is shared as `.env.example`.
* Broad permissions (e.g., `AmazonS3FullAccess`) were only used temporarily.

## Local Development Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
